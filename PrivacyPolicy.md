# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 02/12/2025

**WhatsApp Link Generator** ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Extension works, what data it accesses, and how that data is used.

## Data Collection & Usage

- **No Personal Data Collected:**  
  The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. It functions entirely within your browser and only uses data provided by you in real time (e.g., the text you select or enter in the popup form).

- **Local Processing:**  
  The Extension processes phone numbers locally by extracting digits from the user’s selected text or input before generating a WhatsApp link. This data is not sent to any external servers.

- **Permissions & Host Access:**  
  The Extension requests permissions (such as `contextMenus`, `activeTab`, `scripting`, and `tabs`) only to enable its functionalities. Host permissions (`<all_urls>`) are used solely to inject content scripts that allow the Extension to operate on any webpage. No browsing data or page content is stored or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with any third-party services that may collect personal information.

## Data Security

Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is minimal risk regarding data security. However, we recommend that you review the permissions granted to the Extension and use it only from trusted sources.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated “Last updated” date.
