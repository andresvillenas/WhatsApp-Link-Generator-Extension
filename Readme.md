# WhatsApp Link Generator

**WhatsApp Link Generator** is a lightweight Chrome extension that allows you to generate WhatsApp chat links directly from your browser. Whether you select a phone number on any webpage or enter one manually through the popup form, the extension creates a properly formatted WhatsApp link (https://wa.me/phone_number) to instantly start a chat.

## Features

- **Context Menu Integration:**  
  Right-click a highlighted phone number to automatically generate a WhatsApp chat link and open it in a new tab.

- **Popup Form:**  
  Click the extension icon to open a small form where you can enter a phone number. The extension then generates and opens the WhatsApp link.

- **Smart Phone Number Extraction:**  
  The extension extracts only digits from any selected text, ensuring that the WhatsApp link is formatted correctly (a minimum of 10 digits is required).

- **Auto-closing Tab:**  
  After opening the WhatsApp chat in a new tab, the extension automatically closes the tab after a brief delay, keeping your workspace clutter-free.
